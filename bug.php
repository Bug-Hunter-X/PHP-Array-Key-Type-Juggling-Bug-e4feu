This code suffers from a potential issue related to how PHP handles array keys.  When you use a non-string value as a key, PHP will cast it to a string. This can lead to unexpected key collisions and data loss if you aren't careful about the values you use as keys.

```php
<?php
$array = [];
$array[1] = 'one';
$array[1.0] = 'one point zero';
$array[(int)1.5] = 'one point five';
var_dump($array);
?>
```

Notice that `1`, `1.0`, and `1.5` all become the string key `'1'` in the resulting array.
